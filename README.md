### Word Lists

#### Word List Generator Script

🟢 `lib/ruby-wordle-solver/script-filter.rb`

A ruby script to generate *n*-letter word lists (`word-list.txt` and `word-list-uniq.txt`)

The default *n* value is 5. Change `NUM_LETTERS` if necessary, and run the script as follows. A directory will be created automatically with the title having the number specified in the script (e.g. `word-lists/5-letters`, `word-lists/6-letters`) and resulting word lists will be stored in that directory.
